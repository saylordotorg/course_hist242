**Unit 5: China: From Reform to Revolution** <span id="5"></span> 
*By the late nineteenth century, it was clear that Self-Strengthening
was not enough to keep Europe or the US at bay. Furthermore, Japan was
rapidly modernizing and Chinese students were flocking there to study
the ‘ways of the West’ in the hope that they might be able to ‘save
China’. In the process, many of them transformed from reformist to
revolutionary modernizers, and when they returned to China promoted
their ideas to the public through the newly burgeoning newspaper
industry. Following humiliating and devastating defeat in the 1894-1895
War with Japan, the revolutionaries’ ideas gained traction, and despite
a last-ditch effort by the Qing to enact widespread reforms that would
establish a constitutional monarchy, it was too little too late, and the
Imperial system was swept away in the 1911 Revolution.  
  
 Following the 1911 Revolution, the revolutionaries were unable to
establish a central government and China was ruled at the local level by
various strongmen until the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) was able to
unify the country (with the cooperation of the local warlords) in 1927.
Political disunity, however, did not prevent social and cultural change,
and the period is regarded as one of a great flourishing of new ideas.  
  
 After 1927, the Kuomintang oversaw a period of limited economic growth
and modernization in the eastern part of China, but was never able to
assert nationwide control. Throughout the period, the KMT was also at
loggerheads with the Communists, as well as with Japan, which continued
to encroach on China, culminating ultimately in the 1937 invasion.*
