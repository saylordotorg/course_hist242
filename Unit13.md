**Unit 13: China’s Re-emergence as a Global Power** <span
id="13"></span> 
*With the death of Mao Zedong, the hated ‘Gang of Four’ was arrested and
after a brief two-year transition phase, power handed over to Deng
Xiaoping. Under Deng, China embarked on a path of domestic reform and
opening to foreign trade, modern technologies and knowledge it had once
scorned as ‘bourgeois’, replacing ‘red’ bureaucrats with ‘expert’
technocrats in an effort to effect rapid modernization.  
  
 Needless to say, the modernization path has not always gone smoothly.
As in South Korea and Taiwan during the 1970s, the economy has boomed,
but political liberalization has been stifled, leading to intermittent
protests and official clamp-downs.  
  
 Since the 1990s, economic development has accelerated, leaving many
people behind and leading to rising social inequality and discontent. At
the same time, China’s growth has given it huge economic (and military)
clout internationally, renewing national pride, and fueling an upsurge
in popular nationalism and demands that China take hard-line stances in
international relations. Even though it is not democratically
accountable, the regime thus faces constant challenges in attempting to
retain one-party control, continue economic development that satisfies
its more than a billion consumers, maintain national face in
international dealings, and address discontent from various sectors of
society.*
