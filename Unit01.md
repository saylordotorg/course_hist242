**Unit 1: The Early Modern Era** <span id="1"></span> 
*In this unit, we will first ask some important questions about the
origins of the modern period and the very concept of ‘modern’ itself. We
will then survey the histories of Tokugawa Japan, Qing China and Chos?n
(Joseon) Korea during the time-frame variously known as the ‘late
imperial’, ‘early modern’, or ‘late traditional’ period; that is, the
eighteenth-mid-nineteenth centuries. Examining broad economic,
political, intellectual and social trends during this period, we will
evaluate the extent to which they can be considered ‘traditional’,
‘modern’ or precursors of modern developments. Last, but by no means
least, we will assess the degree to which Japan, Korea and China were
isolated from the outside world by ‘closed door’ or ‘seclusion’ policies
designed to keep the local population in and foreigners out.*
