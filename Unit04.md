**Unit 4: Redrawing the Map: The Changing Balance of Power in Northeast
Asia** <span id="4"></span> 
*This unit examines the rise of Japan as the dominant economic and
military power in the region from the late nineteenth century until
World War II. We will look at why Japan engaged in imperialist expansion
and how its expansionist efforts brought it into conflict over territory
and resources with existing Asian powers (China) and rising ones (Russia
and the US).  We will also examine domestic developments in Japan from
the late Meiji through the Taish? period and into the early Sh?wa period
(until the mid-1930s), and the ways in which they not only shaped
Japanese society, but also supported its foreign exploits. (See Unit 6
for details of Japanese colonial rule.)  
  
 As you work through the primary source materials, pay particular
attention to the ways in which Japan couched its demands of Korea, China
and Russia (the type of language it used), and try to identify some of
the arguments and ideas that were deployed to legitimize Japanese
imperialism.*
