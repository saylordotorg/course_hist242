**Unit 11: Communism in Northeast Asia** <span id="11"></span> 
*With the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, communism gained
a rapid foothold in Northeast Asia. Social reformers were attracted by
the message of equality, nationalists by the fact that Russia—a largely
agrarian, barely industrialized society like their own—could bypass the
historical materialist stage of capitalism (represented by Europe and
the United States) to reach the ‘higher’ evolutionary stage of
socialism.  
 Mongolia, long a target of Tsarist Russian designs, but still under de
jure Chinese sovereignty, found its independence movement quickly taken
over by communists, and was thus able to maintain its de facto
independence from China (achieved in 1921) with support from the USSR,
forming the Mongolian People’s Republic in 1924.  
  
 In colonial Korea, as in the Japanese Home Islands, communism was
suppressed by the Taish? and Sh?wa regimes, but communists, again
supported by the USSR, continued  anti-Japanese resistance activities
from bases across the Korean border in Siberia, resistance which was to
gain them a great deal of support in Korea after liberation.  
  
 In China, the KMT (itself a Leninist party) initially cooperated with
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), but soon began to view it as a
threat, and carried out a brutal purge, driving the CCP into exile. Even
after Japan attacked China, Chiang Kai-Shek, the KMT leader, resisted an
alliance with the CCP, but was finally forced to form a ‘United Front’
against the Japanese. As soon as war with Japan ended, the KMT and the
CCP resumed their conflict.  
  
 In this unit, we will look at the development of these three communist
states, focusing on their economic and political systems, and the ways
in which they adapted communist ideology to suit their own, often
nationalist or authoritarian, purposes. We will also examine the rivalry
for leadership of the international socialist movement between the USSR
and China, and evaluate the impact on each of the three countries
discussed here.*

**Unit11 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Explain the success of communist parties in gaining power in
    Northeast Asia.
-   Classify ideological differences between Communist Parties in China,
    Mongolia and North Korea.
-   Describe the function of economic planning and assess the degree to
    which it helped or hindered growth. Compare this to economic
    planning in non-communist states, such as South Korea and Taiwan.
-   Evaluate the function of ‘struggle’ in maintaining political
    control.
-   Weigh the successes and failures of communist rule in Northeast
    Asia.

    speech was given slightly earlier. The sentiment, however, is the
    same. Pay attention to the kind of language he uses in both
    documents to describe different groups and classes of people e.g.
    “heroic” Chinese people, “reactionary” Kuomintang.
