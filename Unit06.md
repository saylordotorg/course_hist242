**Unit 6: Japanese Colonial Rule in Taiwan and Korea** <span
id="6"></span> 
*Japan acquired its first colony, Taiwan, in 1895, and its second,
Korea, in 1910.  
  
 In this unit, you will study both the ideology and practice of Japanese
imperialism in its new territories. You will learn how and why colonial
authorities adopted particular policies at particular times, and how
these policies were shaped by domestic developments in the Japanese Home
Islands, developments in the colonies themselves, and Japan’s wider
imperialist ambitions.*
