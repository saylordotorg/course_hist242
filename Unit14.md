**Unit 14: Regional Problems and Prospects for the 21st Century** <span
id="14"></span> 
*In the preceding units, we have learned a great deal about the
resurgence of the Northeast Asian region after the humiliation and
debacle at the hands of Western barbarians in the mid-nineteenth
century. Today, the states of the region are once again dominant
economic powers. In this final unit, we look at some of the consequences
and corollaries of the region’s late twentieth century dynamism and
assess some of the problems that have arisen along the way so as better
to evaluate the prospects for the region going forward.*
