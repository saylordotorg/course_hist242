**Unit 2: The Barbarians Are Coming** <span id="2"></span> 
*Since the discovery of new sea-lanes to Asia in the sixteenth century,
commerce between Asia and Europe had accelerated rapidly. Following the
industrial revolution, European traders gradually expanded their
commercial interests in Asia, interests later supported by their
governments with political and military action, leading eventually to
conquest and colonization of many Asian states and societies.  
  
 Japan, China and Korea did not become European colonies, but they were,
nonetheless, profoundly impacted by the European presence in Asia. Under
military pressure, they were forced to lift the tight restrictions they
had formerly imposed on European traders, and to make substantial
concessions to foreign interests, losing some of their political and
economic autonomy in the process.  
  
 In this unit, we will study the arrival of European and US forces and
their efforts to enforce ‘gunboat diplomacy’, as well as the reaction of
the Chinese, Japanese and Koreans to peoples they had long considered
‘barbarians’, uncivilized and uncouth, possessing next-to-nothing that
Northeast Asians could possibly want.*
