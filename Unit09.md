**Unit 9: Japan: Out of the Ashes** <span id="9"></span> 
This unit studies the history of Japan from the end of WWII to the
1990s. It explores the impact of the US occupation and the Cold War, and
the formulation of a new constitution on subsequent political and
economic development. It also addresses the question of war
responsibility and guilt (a topic to which we will return in the final
unit in the context of regional relations), and the ways in which this
has affected Japan’s self-identity as a ‘Peace State’.
