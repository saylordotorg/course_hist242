**Unit 12: Democratization in South Korea, Taiwan and Mongolia** <span
id="12"></span> 
*Despite (or perhaps because of) economic success in South Korea and
Taiwan, long championed by the state as a justification for continued
authoritarian rule, the clamor for democracy did not cease. In the face
of growing domestic and international pressure, the regimes in both
countries finally relented and began to implement democratic reforms,
first at the local, then at the national level. Since the 1990s, both
countries have had vibrant representative democracy and an entirely free
(and frequently highly partisan) press. Mongolia, meanwhile,
democratized following the adoption of the perestroikaand
glasnostpolicies in the USSR. As in the USSR, the reforms were soon not
felt to have gone far enough, and following massive demonstrations in
early 1990, multiparty democracy was introduced and direct election of
the president authorized.  
  
 In all three countries, however, much of the authoritarian old guard
(bureaucrats or political parties) has continued to enjoy power in the
democracy era. In addition to examining the origins and course of
democratization, therefore, this unit also explores the domestic and
international factors shaping the composition of the new regimes.*
