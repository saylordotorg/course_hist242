**Unit 7: Social and Cultural Change in the Early Twentieth Century**
<span id="7"></span> 
*Despite the initial efforts of the traditional elite to adopt little
more from the Western barbarians than advanced industrial and military
technologies, a market for translations of foreign writings quickly
emerged, exposing the literate classes to a wide range of ideas, many of
which challenged the traditional social and political order. Likewise,
ever-growing numbers of students traveled to Europe and the USA where
they studied far more than mere ‘techniques’. When they returned, they
often promoted radical political and social ideas, in both political
writings and activities, and through art forms, such as literature, film
and theater. As cities expanded and the numbers of educated urbanites
grew, a consumer culture began to emerge.  
  
 In this unit, we will examine cross-regional as well as nation-specific
trends in culture and society that emerged during the late nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, focusing on the roles played by
education, rising literacy, and the emergence of a new intelligentsia as
‘producers’ of ideas, and on the place of consumers in the new
society.
