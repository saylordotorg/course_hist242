Only 150 years ago, the empires and states of Northeast Asia—for many
centuries far more developed than their contemporaries in most of Asia,
and all of Europe, the Americas and Africa—found themselves powerless in
the face of the military, technological and economic might of the
European imperialist powers and the United States. Yet, today, most of
these states have once again become key players in the contemporary
world order: economically, politically, culturally, and, in many
instances, militarily. In this course, we will study how and why the
‘modern’ transformation of Northeast Asia came about, examining both the
indigenous and foreign ideas and institutions on which the
transformations were based, and comparing how change manifested in
different times and places. We will analyze many of the problems faced
both domestically and internationally during this transformation, and
will evaluate the prospects for the region in the 21<sup>st</sup>
century. In order to do so, we will trace the political, economic and
cultural development of Northeast Asia from late imperial times (the
eighteenth-nineteenth centuries) to the present. In particular, we will
analyze tensions within and between countries over power, status and
resources, assess the challenges of preserving ‘tradition’ while
attaining ‘modernity’, and distinguish competing concepts of
‘modernization’ and ideas about how it should be accomplished. We will
also assess the importance of ideas and ideologies (such as nationalism,
imperialism, communism, capitalism), and the ways in which they
affected—and continue to affect—the domestic political, economic and
social development of individual countries, and shape their relations
with other states within and beyond the region. Using both primary
sources (such as government documents, speeches and writings by major
political, intellectual, and cultural figures of the time, artifacts of
everyday life, still and moving images) and secondary sources (such as
lectures and readings), we will attempt to understand and evaluate some
of the past and present dynamics of this most dynamic region both from
‘within’ and from ‘without’.

### Learning Outcomes

Subject-Specific Learning Objectives  
  
 Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Describe the structure of state and society in China, Japan, and
    Korea during the late imperial era, and identify similarities and
    differences between them.
-   Analyze the domestic and international factors that catalyzed
    institutional and social change in Japan, China, and Korea during
    the late nineteenth century.
-   Compare and contrast the process, extent and speed of economic,
    political, social and cultural change in Japan, China, and Korea
    during this period.
-   Assess the relative influence of different ideas (indigenous,
    foreign and hybrid) in shaping social and political change in each
    country.
-   Identify and evaluate the factors that underpinned Japanese
    imperialism and led to the outbreak of war in Asia in the 1930s.
-   Classify and interpret similarities and differences between
    experiences of Japanese imperialism in Taiwan, Korea and China.
-   Explain the origins of the division of Korea after WWII and the
    causes and outcomes of war on the peninsula.
-   Account for the economic success of Japan in the post-WWII period.
-   Evaluate the relationship between authoritarian rule and economic
    development in Taiwan and South Korea, and compare their experiences
    with that of Hong Kong.
-   Summarize and assess the successes and failures of Communism in
    China, North Korea and Mongolia.
-   Compare the process of democratization in South Korea and Taiwan.
-   Explain the resurgence of China as a global power, and assess the
    impact it has had on the economic and political dynamics of the
    region.
-   Analyze the threat to regional stability posed by North Korea.
-   Identify and evaluate the implications of major political, economic,
    social, demographic, environmental and technological changes in the
    twenty-first century.

Historical Thinking Objectives:  
  
 Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Analyze and interpret primary sources.
-   Identify and explain possible reasons for ‘bias’ in primary and
    secondary sources, e.g. through examining who is writing, when and
    where he/she is writing, how he/she is writing (the type of language
    used), and for whom he/she is writing (who is paying and who is the
    intended audience).
-   Recognize that multiple answers are possible to many questions—that
    there is not necessarily a single, ‘correct’ answer (although there
    may be ‘wrong’ ones). 
-   In order to do this, you must learn to interpret and deploy
    evidenceto support or refute an argument, opinion, or idea. As you
    work through this course, you will be given questions and
    suggestions to help you critically evaluate the sources you are
    using.
