**Unit 3: Reform and Resistance** <span id="3"></span> 
*Despite the widespread view of Europeans and Americans as barbarians,
it was quickly recognized that the weapons and technologies which had
allowed them easily to vanquish the dominant Asian power, Qing China,
might be worth studying if Asia were to be able to resist continued
foreign incursions and humiliations, as well as to defeat various
rebellious uprisings that had erupted on home-soil (largely unrelated to
the Western intrusion).  
  
 Efforts were accordingly made to learn from the West, at least insofar
as science and technology were concerned.  Western ideas and
institutions, on the other hand, were regarded by most of the ruling
elite as entirely unsuited to local conditions, and thus—under slogans
such as ‘Chinese learning for the essence, Western learning for
practical application’ and ‘Eastern ethics, Western science’—attempts
were made to implement a ‘self-strengthening’ programme that would allow
industrial and military modernization without undermining the
traditional political or value systems.  
  
 Not everyone, of course, held the same view, and many were eager to
learn more than mere ‘techniques’. Tensions accordingly arose between
those who did not want to see any kind of institutional reform, and
those who pursued thoroughgoing, even revolutionary, change. As you work
through this unit, you will see that the pace and scope of change varied
quite significantly between Japan, China and Korea. Note some of the key
factors that might explain why reform was more easily implemented in
Japan than it was in China and Korea. *
