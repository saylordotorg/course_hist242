**Unit 8: Hot and Cold Wars** <span id="8"></span> 
*The tensions in Northeast Asia and Japan’s intensifying expansionist
ambitions led ultimately to the outbreak of war in 1937. While the
Japanese had imagined a swift conquest of China would be possible, and
quickly overran the industrialized eastern heartland, the western half
of the country proved much more inaccessible. Japan became bogged down
in a long conflict, while simultaneously expanding into Southeast Asia
and taking on the US. Despite spreading its resources so thinly, Japan
was able to wage a long and often successful campaign, but finally
surrendered after the US dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in August 1945.  
  
 Despite the horrors endured in WWII, both Korea—liberated from Japanese
colonial rule, but occupied by the USA and USSR—and China descended
almost immediately into civil war. In this unit, we focus on the causes
and consequences of this long wartime period, examining the effect of
defeat on Japan, and paying particular attention to the role of the Cold
War in driving the ‘hot’ wars in Northeast Asia.*

    all the details of the war described (you can fast-forward through

    obvious in the introduction and conclusion of the film.) Can you
    identify some examples of ‘facts’ used to support the anti-Communist
    message of the film? Based on the film, why was the war fought and
