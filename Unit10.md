**Unit 10: The Asian Tigers** <span id="10"></span> 
*After WWII, Japan quickly rebounded. It was economically booming by the
1960s, and was one of the richest countries in the world from the 1970s
onwards. The Japanese ‘miracle’, was soon followed by spectacular
economic growth in the “Four Little Tigers”: Hong Kong, Singapore, South
Korea and Taiwan. In this unit, we will explore the origins of this
growth (excluding Singapore), as well as some of the domestic and
international political factors and social and cultural matrices that
may have catalyzed or obstructed it along the way. We will also examine
the ways in which economic success was deployed by authoritarian regimes
to stave off calls for democratization, and assess whether indeed
authoritarian rule was a necessary condition for development (an
argument China uses today, as we will see in Unit 13).*

-   Describe and analyze the reasons for opposition to authoritarian
    rule.
-   Assess the role of the international climate (especially the Cold
    War) in perpetuating authoritarian rule.
